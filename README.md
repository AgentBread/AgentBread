### Hello!
I am a self-thaught programming enthusiast, coming from the field of Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, with some academic programming experience integrating various tools to establish a real-time image acquisition and tracking setup at the Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) Vienna and a constant thirst for learning more. Exciting past work experience includes a research internship at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, tinkering with E.coli protein expression and *DNA Origami* nanostructures, and a Regulatory Affairs job. 

I always appreciate any constructive feedback, good coffee and hand-made bread!

Currently, I creating small programs in Python3 that help analyse and visualize protein structures.
